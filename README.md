# School District Analysis

## Overview
This project was focused on analyzing the High Schools in a specific district to assess how well students were doing. We were given raw data which we cleaned and queried using Jupyter Notebook. In our assessment we looked at how the amount of funding per student impacted grades, as well as how student performance varied in charter and public schools.
